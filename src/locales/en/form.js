  PS_1_description:
    "Dear applicant,<br><br/>Before you start filling in the personal statement, please carefully read the following general information about the scholarship programme of the Martin Roth-Initiative (MRI).<br><br/>You are applying for an MRI scholarship and temporary residency at a host cultural organisation in Germany. Please note that the maximum duration of the scholarship period is 12 months. In very exceptional cases, this period can be extended for up to another 12 months.<br><br/>Please note that, in addition to this personal statement, your potential host organisation is required to submit a duly completed application form. This application comprises a comprehensive project plan, including specific objectives and a budget for project activities, such as continuation of artistic/cultural work, professional trainings, language courses, psychosocial support etc. Please make sure that you are in close consultation with your potential host organisation about the project activities detailed in the form as well as the budget of the project.<br><br/>Due to the temporary nature of our programme, MRI’s assistance comes to an end once the scholarship period is over. It is therefore essential that you and your host organisation set a clear outlook in the personal statement/application form for the time after the scholarship period is over. Please provide a clear strategy for how you plan to use the time during the MRI scholarship period to prepare for future plans (exit strategy). MRI scholarship holders will receive support from the host organisation and the MRI to continue working on their exit strategy throughout the project period.Your main point of contact during the application period and, in case of approval, throughout the scholarship period will be the host organisation.<br><br/>Please note that within each scholarship period there are three mandatory meetings (at the beginning, middle and end of the stay) between scholarship holder, host organisation and the MRI.<br><br/>Please note that you must immediately inform the host organisation and the MRI if the data in your Personal Statement is no longer up to date. This is particularly important in reference to the details of your emergency contact person.<br><br/>Please note that there is no legal right to receive funding from the MRI. The MRI is only able to process complete applications. After a formal review of all submitted documents, an independent committee consisting of members of the art and cultural scene and representatives of civil society institutions will decide on the awarding of funding for applicant projects.<br><br/>Please take the time to answer the questions below thoroughly and do not hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any further questions.",
